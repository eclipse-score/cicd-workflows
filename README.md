## Using the Workflows in Your Repository

To use a reusable workflow, create a workflow file inside **your repository** (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and reference the appropriate workflow from this repository.

### **1. Documentation Build Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml 
name: Documentation CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docs:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/docs.yml@main
    with:
      retention-days: 3
      # Optionally override:
      # workflow-version: main
      # bazel-target: "//docs:github-pages"
```
This workflow:

✅ Builds project documentation  
✅ Uploads it as an artifact  
✅ Deploys it to **GitHub Pages** on push to `main`  

---

### **2. Documentation Cleanup Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml
name: Documentation Cleanup

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # every day at 2am UTC

✅ Ensures code adheres to formatting rules before merge

> ℹ️ **Note:** You can override the Bazel command using the `bazel-target` input.  
> **Default:** `test //:format.check`

---
### **10. Required Approvals Workflow**

This workflow enforces **stricter CODEOWNERS checks** than GitHub’s defaults.  
Normally, GitHub requires approval from *any one* codeowner when multiple are listed.  
With this workflow, you can enforce that **all required teams approve** (or set a minimum count).

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: Enforce Approvals

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, edited, dismissed]

jobs:
  enforce:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/required-approvals.yml@main
    with:
      pat_secret: SCORE_BOT_PAT
      # Optional overrides:
      # min_approvals: 2
      # approval_mode: ALL
      # org_name: qorix-group
```

**Defaults**  
- `org_name`: `score`  
- `min_approvals`: `1`  
- `approval_mode`: `ALL`  
- `require_all_approvals_latest_commit`: always `true`  

**Key Features**  
✅ Enforces that *all relevant CODEOWNERS* approve (`ALL` mode)  
✅ Invalidates approvals on new commits (`require_all_approvals_latest_commit`)  
✅ Works with **org secrets** (e.g. `SCORE_BOT_PAT`) that must have `repo` + `read:org` scopes  
✅ Compatible with branch protection rules → can be marked as **required**  

---


### **11. QNX Build (Gated) Workflow**

Use this workflow when you need QNX secrets for forked PRs and want a manual approval gate via an environment.

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: Scrample QNX (gated)

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  qnx-build:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/qnx-build.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
    with:
      bazel-target: "//..." # optional, default shown
      bazel-config: "x86_64-qnx"     # optional, default shown
      credential-helper: ".github/tools/qnx_credential_helper.py" # optional, default shown
      environment-name: "workflow-approval" # optional, default shown
      extra-bazel-flags: "--lockfile_mode=error" # optional, pass explicitly when needed
    secrets:
      score-qnx-license: ${{ secrets.SCORE_QNX_LICENSE }}
      score-qnx-user: ${{ secrets.SCORE_QNX_USER }}
      score-qnx-password: ${{ secrets.SCORE_QNX_PASSWORD }}
```

**Notes**
- Runs on `pull_request_target` so maintainers can approve the `workflow-approval` environment before secrets are used.
- Installs the QNX license, builds with the configured Bazel target/config, and cleans up the license directory.
- Additional Bazel flags are caller-controlled via `extra-bazel-flags`; the workflow does not enable `--lockfile_mode=error` by default.

---

### **12. Documentation Verification Workflow**

This workflow verifies that documentation builds correctly and can be used to validate documentation changes in pull requests.

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: Documentation Verification

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  docs-verify:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/docs-verify.yml@main
    with:
      bazel-docs-verify-target: "//:docs_check" # optional, default shown
```

**Defaults**  
- `bazel-docs-verify-target`: `//:docs_check`  

**Key Features**  
✅ Verifies documentation builds successfully  
✅ Uses Bazel-based documentation checks  
✅ Provides verification result as output  
✅ Integrates with Bazel shared caching for performance  

---

### **13. CodeQL Security Scan Workflow**

This workflow performs security and quality analysis using GitHub's CodeQL with MISRA C++ coding standards.

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: CodeQL Security Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # Weekly on Monday

jobs:
  codeql-scan:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/codeql.yml@main
    with:
      build-script: "bazel build //..." # optional, default shown
```

**Defaults**  
- `build-script`: `bazel build //...`  

**Key Features**  
✅ Scans C/C++ code for security vulnerabilities and bugs  
✅ Applies MISRA C++ coding standards  
✅ Uploads SARIF results as artifacts  
✅ Integrates with GitHub Security tab  
✅ Supports custom Bazel build commands  

---

### **14. SCORE PR Checks Workflow**

This workflow enforces SCORE-specific standards, particularly Bazel module naming conventions.

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: PR Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  score-checks:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/score-pr-checks.yml@main
```

**No inputs required**

**Key Features**  
✅ Validates Bazel module names follow the pattern `^score_[[:lower:]_]+$`  
✅ Ensures module names start with `score_`  
✅ Allows only lowercase letters and underscores  
✅ Skips validation if no `MODULE.bazel` file exists  

**Examples of valid module names:**  
- `score_cli`  
- `score_compose`  
- `score_web_api`  

---

### **15. Template Sync Workflow**

This workflow automatically synchronizes your repository with the latest changes from `eclipse-score/module_template`.

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: Template Sync

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  template-sync:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/template-sync.yml@main
    with:
      pr_title: "[Template Sync] Upstream template update" # optional, default shown
      pr_commit_msg: "chore(template): upstream template update" # optional, default shown
      template_sync_ignore_file_path: ".github/.templatesyncignore" # optional, default shown
    secrets:
      SCORE_APPROVALS_PAT: ${{ secrets.SCORE_APPROVALS_PAT }}
```

**Defaults**  
- `pr_title`: `[Template Sync] Upstream template update`  
- `pr_commit_msg`: `chore(template): upstream template update`  
- `template_sync_ignore_file_path`: `.github/.templatesyncignore`  

**Key Features**  
✅ Automatically creates PRs with template updates  
✅ Respects `.templatesyncignore` file to exclude specific files  
✅ Uses `SCORE_APPROVALS_PAT` secret for authentication  
✅ Configurable PR titles and commit messages  
✅ Can be triggered on schedule or manually  

> ℹ️ **Note:** This workflow requires the `SCORE_APPROVALS_PAT` secret with appropriate permissions to create pull requests.

---

### **16. Bzlmod Lockfile Check Workflow**

This workflow keeps Bazel's lockfile in sync with your module declarations. It records the exact set of resolved module versions and extension outputs so builds are reproducible across machines. The job fails if the lockfile is missing or out of date after running `bazel mod tidy`, which means someone changed `MODULE.bazel` without updating the lockfile.

**Usage Example**

```yaml
name: Bzlmod Lockfile Check

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  bzlmod-lock:
    uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/bzlmod-lock-check.yml@main
    with:
      working-directory: .
```

**Defaults**  
- `working-directory`: `.`  

This workflow:  
✅ Fails if `MODULE.bazel.lock` is missing  
✅ Runs `bazel mod tidy`  
✅ Fails if `MODULE.bazel` or `MODULE.bazel.lock` changes after tidy  

---


##  How to Update Workflows
Since these workflows are centralized, updates in the `cicd-workflows` repository will **automatically apply to all repositories using them**. If you need a specific version, reference a **tagged release** instead of `main`:
```yaml
uses: eclipse-score/cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/tests.yml@v1.0.0
```

---

## ⚡️ Bazel Setup with Shared Caching

To improve performance and reduce redundant downloads across workflow runs, the reusable workflows configure Bazel with shared caching:

```yaml
- name: Setup Bazel with shared caching
  uses: bazel-contrib/setup-bazel@0.18.0
  with:
    disk-cache: true
    repository-cache: true
    bazelisk-cache: true
    cache-save: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
```

### Benefits

- **`disk-cache`**: Stores compiled Bazel outputs across jobs.
- **`repository-cache`**: Caches external dependencies (e.g., modules, WORKSPACE fetches).
- **`bazelisk-cache`**: Avoids re-downloading Bazel binaries.
- **`cache-save`**: Saves the cache only on push events to avoid unnecessary cache updates (e.g., from pull requests).

This setup significantly reduces CI build time and improves reuse across different workflows.


### **Summary**
✅ **Standardized** CI/CD workflows across all projects  
✅ **Reusable & Maintainable** with centralized updates  
✅ **Bazel-powered** for consistent testing & analysis

## 🏃‍♂️ Runner Selection Logic

All workflows in this repository use the following logic for selecting the runner:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ vars.REPO_RUNNER_LABELS && fromJSON(vars.REPO_RUNNER_LABELS) || 'ubuntu-latest' }}
```

This means:

- If your repository defines a variable named `REPO_RUNNER_LABELS` (e.g., in repository or organization settings), its value will be used as the runner label(s).  
  This allows you to use **self-hosted runners** or any custom runner configuration.
- If `REPO_RUNNER_LABELS` is **not set**, the workflow will default to GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest`.

**Why?**  
This approach allows forked repositories or projects with special requirements to use their own runners, while everyone else gets a reliable default.

> ℹ️ **Tip:** To use a self-hosted runner, set the `REPO_RUNNER_LABELS` variable in your repository or organization settings to the label(s) of your runner.
